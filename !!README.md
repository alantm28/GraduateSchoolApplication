# GraduateSchoolApplication
MATLAB and Python code for UHM Graduate School Application.

MATLAB files have the extension .m

Python files have the extension .ipynb : I recommend clicking on the "display rendered blob" option (the folded piece of paper) to make it easier to read.

Thank you for taking the time to look at my coding portfolio.
